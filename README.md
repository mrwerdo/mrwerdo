### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer who has a passion for understanding how systems work. I love helping other people and create well-thought out solutions for tricky problems. People know me as someone who listens and thinks before taking action.

Technologies I have a non-zero amount of experience using include Angular, Arch Linux, BSD Sockets, C, C++, C#, CoreGraphics, Docker, Git, Java, Objective-C, OpenGL, Python, Metal, Swift, SwiftUI, Typescript, and UIKit. I'm currently learning React and am experimenting with Airtable.

*Fun fact*: did you know that people speak at approximately 39 bits per second irrespective of their language?
